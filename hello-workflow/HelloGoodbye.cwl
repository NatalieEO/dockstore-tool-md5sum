# Top level inputs and outputs of the workflow are described in the inputs and outputs fields respectively.

# The inputs section describes the inputs of the workflow.
# This is a list of input parameters where each parameter consists of an identifier
# and a data type.
# These parameters can be used as sources for input to specific workflows steps.
inputs:
    myName: File

# The outputs section describes the outputs of the workflow. This is a list of output
# parameters where each parameter consists of an identifier and a data type.
# There are two outputs from this workflow, both are files, and one output called
# 'hello_byFile' is a file that is produced by the hello step.
outputs:
  hello_byFile:
    type: File
    outputSource: hello/outFile
  goodbye_byFile:
    type: File
    outputSource: goodbye/outFile



# The steps section describes the actual steps of the workflow.
# Each step in a workflow must have its own CWL description.
# Workflow steps are not necessarily run in the order they are listed, instead
# the order is determined by the dependencies between steps (using source). In
# addition, workflow steps which do not depend on one another may run in parallel.

# The first step runs a CWL tool described in hello.cwl and produces an
# output called 'outFile'
steps:
  hello:
    run: hello.cwl
    in:
      myName: myName
    out: [outFile]

  goodbye:
    run: goodbye.cwl
    in:
      greeting: myName
    out: [outFile]
